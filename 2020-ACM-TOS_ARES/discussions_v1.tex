 %For a read/write algorithm
%that uses the presented data-primitives, it can provide atomic guarantees if the data primitives 
%satisfy the following consistency properties: 
%To implement an algorithm, which is based on the DAP primitives, the DAP primitives must satisfy the following
%consistency properties.


In this section, we argue that  various implementations of DAPs  can be used in \ares{}. In fact, via \act{reconfig} 
operations, one can implement a highly adaptive 
%strongly consistent 
atomic DSS: 
replication-based can be transformed into erasure-code based DSS; increase or decrease the number of storage servers; 
 study 
the performance of the DSS under various code parameters, etc. 
The insight to implementing various DAPs comes from the observation that the  simple  algorithmic 
	template $A$ (see Alg.~\ref{algo:atomicity:generic1}) for reads and writes protocol combined with 
	any implementation of DAPs, satisfying Property~\ref{property:dap} gives rise to a MWMR atomic memory service.
	Moreover, the read and writes operations terminate as long as the implemented DAPs complete. 
%	implements an atomic  storage if the implementation of the  DAPs satisfy Property \ref{property:dap}, and $A$ preserves liveness (termination),
%	if every invocation of the used DAPs terminate.

	A read operation in $A$ performs $\dagetdata{c}$ to retrieve a tag-value pair, $\tup{\tg{},v}$ from a configuration $c$, and then 
	it performs a $c.\act{put-data}(\tup{\tg{},v})$ to propagate that pair to the configuration $c$. A write operation is similar to the read but before 
	performing the $\act{put-data}$ action it generates a new tag which associates with the value to be written.

The following result shows 
	%\cite{ARES:Arxiv:2018} 
	that $A$ is atomic and live,
	if the DAPs satisfy Property~\ref{property:dap} and live.
	 
 \begin{theorem}[\nn{Atomicity} of template $A$]\label{atomicity:A1}
 Suppose the DAP implementation satisfies the consistency properties $C1$ and $C2$ of  Property \ref{def:consistency}
 for a configuration $c\in\confSet$. 
 Then any execution $\EX$  of \nn{algorithm $A$ in configuration $c$}
 %the  atomicity protocols $A_1$  on a 
 %fixed set of servers $S$, of some 
 %configuration $c\in\confSet$,  
 %as in Fig. ~\ref{algo:atomicity:generic1} satisfies atomic read and write and is live if the  primitive functions are live in $\xi$.
 is atomic and live if each DAP \nn{invocation terminates} in $\EX$ \nn{under the failure model $c.\mathcal{F}$}.
 \end{theorem}
 A number of known tag-based algorithms that implement atomic read/write objects 
	(e.g., ABD \cite{ABD96}, \fast \cite{CDGL04} -- see \cite{ARES:Arxiv:2018}), can be expressed 
	in terms of DAP.
