We presented an algorithmic framework suitable for reconfigurable, 
 erasure code-based atomic memory service in asynchronous,  message-passing environments.
%We also provided a new two-round  erasure code-based algorithm that has near optimal storage cost,  and 
%bandwidth  costs per read or write operation.
% Moreover, this algorithm is suitable specifically where during
%new configuration installation  the object values passes directly from servers in older configuration to those
%in the newer configurations.
 Future work will involve adding efficient repair and reconfiguration using regenerating codes.
