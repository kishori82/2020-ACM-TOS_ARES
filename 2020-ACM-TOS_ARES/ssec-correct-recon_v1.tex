In this section we analyze the properties that we can achieve through our reconfiguration algorithm. 
The first lemma shows that any two configuration sequences have the same configuration identifiers
in the same indexes. 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:consconf}
	For any reconfigurer $r$ that invokes an $\act{reconfig}(c)$ action in an execution $\EX$ 
	of the algorithm, If $r$ chooses to install $c$ in index $k$ of its local $r.cseq$ vector, then $r$ invokes 
	the $Cons[k-1].propose(c)$ instance over configuration $r.cseq[k-1].cfg$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	It follows directly from the algorithm. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:server:monotonic}
	If a server $s$ sets $s.nextC$ to $\tup{c,F}$ at some state $\st$ in an execution $\EX$ 
	of the algorithm, then $s.nextC = \tup{c,F}$ for any state $\st'$ that appears after $\st$ in 
	$\EX$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Notice that a server $s$ updates the $s.nextC$ variable for some specific configuration $c_k$ 
	in a state $st$ if: (i) $s$ did not receive any value for $c_k$ before (and thus $nextC=\bot$), or (ii) $s$ 
	received a tuple $\tup{c,P}$ and before $\st$ received the tuple $\tup{c',F}$. By Observation \ref{obs:consensus}
	$c=c'$ as $s$ updates the $s.nextC$ of the same configuration $c_k$. Once the tuple becomes equal to 
	$\tup{c,F}$ then $s$ does not satisfy the update condition for $c_k$, and hence in any state $\st'$ after $\st$
	it does not change $\tup{c,F}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Configuration Uniqueness]
\label{lem:unique}

	%Let $\st_1$ and $\st_2$ be any two states of an execution $\EX$ of the algorithm,
	%and $\pr, q$ two participating processes. 
	%be the state after the response action of an operation $\op_1$ from process $p$,
	%and $\st_2$ be the state after the first $\act{read-config}$ call of an operation $\op_2$ from $q$.
	For any processes $\pr, q\in \idSet$ and any states $\st_1, \st_2$ in an execution $\EX$, it must hold that 
	$\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[i]}=\config{\cvec{q}{\st_2}[i]}$,  $\forall i$ s.t. 
	$\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[i]},\config{\cvec{q}{\st_2}[i]}\neq \bot$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The lemma holds trivially for $\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[0]}=\config{\cvec{q}{\st_2}[0]}=c_0$. 
	So in the rest of the proof we focus in the case where $i > 0$. Let us assume 
	w.l.o.g. that $\st_1$ appears before $\st_2$ in $\EX$.
	
	According to our algorithm a process $\pr$ sets $\pr.cseq[i].cfg$ to a configuration 
	identifier $c$ in two cases: (i) either it received $c$ as the result of the consensus 
	instance in configuration $\pr.cseq[i-1].cfg$, or (ii) $\pr$ receives $\config{s.nextC} = c$ from 
	a server $s\in\servers{\config{\pr.cseq[i-1]}}$. Note here that (i) is possible only 
	when $\pr$ is a reconfigurer and attempts to install a new configuration. On the 
	other hand (ii) may be executed by any process in any operation that invokes the 
	$\act{read-config}$ action. We are going 
	to proof this lemma by induction on the configuration index. 
	

	\emph{Base case:} The base case of the lemma is when $i=1$. 
	Let us first assume that $p$ and $q$ receive $c_p$ and $c_q$, as the result of the consensus instance at $\pr.cseq[0].cfg$
	and $q.cseq[0].cfg$ respectively. By Lemma \ref{lem:consconf}, since both processes want to install a configuration 
	in $i=1$, then they have to run $Cons[0]$ instance over the configuration stored in their local $cseq[0].cfg$ variable. 
	Since $\pr.cseq[0].cfg=q.cseq[0].cfg=c_0$ then 
	both $Cons[0]$ instances run over the same configuration $c_0$ and according to Observation \ref{obs:consensus}  
	return the same value, say $c_1$. Hence $c_p=c_q=c_1$ and $\pr.cseq[1].cfg=q.cseq[1].cfg=c_1$.
	 
	 Let us examine the case now where $p$ or $q$ 
	assign a configuration $c$ they received from some server $s\in\servers{c_0}$. According to the
	algorithm only the configuration that has been decided by the consensus instance on 
	$c_0$ is propagated to the servers in $\servers{c_0}$. If $c_1$ is the decided configuration, then 
	$\forall s\in\servers{c_0}$ such that $s.nextC(c_0)\neq\bot$, it holds that $s.nextC(C_0) = \tup{c_1,*}$.
	So if $p$ or $q$ set $\pr.cseq[1].cfg$ or $q.cseq[1].cfg$ to some received configuration, then 
	$\pr.cseq[1].cfg = q.cseq[1].cfg = c_1$ in this case as well. 
	
     \emph{Hypothesis:} We assume  that 
	$\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k]=\cvec{q}{\st_2}[k]$  for some $k$, $k \geq 1$.
	
	%\noindent{\bf Induction Hypothesis:} 
	\emph{Induction Step:}  We need to show that the lemma holds for $i=k+1$.
	If both processes retrieve $\config{\pr.cseq[k+1]}$ and $\config{q.cseq[k+1]}$ through consensus, 
	then both $\pr$ and $q$ run consensus
	over the previous configuration. Since according to our hypothesis 
	$\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k]=\cvec{q}{\st_2}[k]$ then both process will receive the same
	decided value, say $c_{k+1}$, and hence $\pr.cseq[k+1].cfg=q.cseq[k+1].cfg=c_{k+1}$. Similar to the base case,
	a server in $\servers{c_k}$ only receives the configuration $c_{k+1}$ decided by the consensus instance run over $c_k$. 
	So processes 
	$\pr$ and $q$ can only receive $c_{k+1}$ from some server in $\servers{c_k}$ 
	%even if the processes update their $\pr.cseq[k+1].cfg$ or $q.cseq[k+1].cfg$ with a received 
	%configuration that will be equal to 
	so they can only assign $\pr.cseq[k+1].cfg=q.cseq[k+1].cfg=c_{k+1}$ at Line \ref{algo:reconfigurer}:\ref{line:readconfig:assign}.
	That completes the proof. 
\end{proof}


Lemma \ref{lem:unique} showed that any two operations store the same
configuration in any cell $k$ of their $cseq$ variable. It is not known however 
if the two processes discover the same number of configuration ids. In the following
lemmas we will show that if a process learns about a configuration in a cell $k$ 
then it also learns about all configuration ids for every index $i$, such that $0\leq i\leq k-1$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:confmonotonic}
	In any execution $\EX$ of the algorithm , If for any process $\pr\in\idSet$, $\cvec{\pr}{\st}[i]\neq\bot$ in some state $\st$ in $\EX$,
	then $\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[i]\neq\bot$ in any state $\st'$ that appears after $\st$ in $\EX$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	A value is assigned to $\cvec{\pr}{*}[i]$ either after the invocation of a consensus instance, or while executing
	the $\act{read-config}$ action. Since any configuration proposed for installation cannot be $\bot$ (A\ref{algo:reconfigurer}:\ref{line:install:valid}), 
	and since there is at least one configuration proposed in the consensus instance (the one from $\pr$), then by the validity of the consensus
	service the decision will be a configuration $c\neq\bot$. Thus, in this case $\cvec{\pr}{*}[i]$ cannot be $\bot$.
	Also in the $\act{read-config}$ procedure, $\cvec{\pr}{*}[i]$ is assigned to a value different than $\bot$ according
	to Line A\ref{algo:reconfigurer}:L\ref{line:readconfig:assign}. Hence, if $\cvec{\pr}{\st}[i]\neq\bot$ at state $\st$ 
	then it cannot become $\bot$ in any state $\st'$ after $\st$ in execution $\EX$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:nogaps}
	Let $\st_1$ be some state in an execution $\EX$ of the algorithm. Then for any 
	process $\pr$, if $k = max\{i: \cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[i]\neq \bot\}$, then 
	$\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[j]\neq \bot$, for $0\leq j < k$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let us assume to derive contradiction that there exists $j < k$ such that 
	$\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[j]=\bot$ and $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[j+1]\neq\bot$.
	Suppose w.l.o.g. that $j = k-1$ and that $\st_1$ is the state immediately 
	after the assignment of a value to $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k]$, say $c_k$. 
	Since $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k]\neq\bot$, then $\pr$ assigned $c_k$ to $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k]$ 
	in one of the following cases: 
	(i) $c_k$ was the result of the consensus instance, or
	(ii) $\pr$ received $c_k$ from a server during a $\act{read-config}$ action.
	The first case is trivially impossible as according to Lemma \ref{lem:consconf} 
	$\pr$ decides for $k$ when it runs consensus over configuration $\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k-1]}$. 
	Since this is equal to $\bot$, then we cannot run consensus over a non-existent set of 
	processes. 	In the second case, $\pr$ assigns $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k] = c_k$  in Line A\ref{algo:parser}:\ref{line:readconfig:assign}.
	The value $c_k$ was however obtained when $\pr$ invoked $\act{get-next-config}$ on 
	configuration $\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k-1]}$. In that action, $\pr$ sends {\sc read-config}
	messages to the servers in $\servers{\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k-1]}}$ and waits until a quorum 
	of servers replies. Since we assigned $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k] = c_k$ it means that $\act{get-next-config}$
	terminated at some state $\st'$ before $\st_1$ in $\EX$, and thus: 
	(a) a quorum of servers in $\servers{\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[k-1]}}$
	replied, and (b) there exists a server $s$ among those that replied with $c_k$. 
	According to our assumption however, $\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[k-1] = \bot$ at $\st_1$. 
	So if state $\st'$ is before $\st_1$ in $\EX$, %is the state after the response step of $\act{get-next-config}$, 
	then by Lemma \ref{lem:confmonotonic}, it follows that $\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[k-1] = \bot$. This however 
	implies that $\pr$ communicated with an empty configuration, and thus no server replied to $\pr$. 
	This however contradicts the assumption that a server replied with $c_k$ to $\pr$. 
	
	Since any process traverses the configuration sequence starting from the initial 
	configuration $c_0$, then with a simple induction we can show that 
	$\cvec{\pr}{\st_1}[j]\neq \bot$, for $0\leq j\leq k$.
\end{proof}

We can now move to an important lemma that shows that any \act{read-config} action 
returns an extension of the configuration sequence returned by any previous \act{read-config} action. 
First, we show that the last finalized configuration observed by any \act{read-config} action is at least as 
recent as the finalized configuration observed by any subsequent \act{read-config} action. 
%Using this lemma we will then show that when 

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:config:propagation}
	If at a state $\st$ of an execution $\EX$ of the algorithm, if $\mu(\cvec{\pr}{\st}) = k$ % = \max\{i: \cvec{\pr}{\st}[i]\neq\bot\}$
	for some process $\pr$, then for any element $0\leq j < k$, $\exists Q\in \quorums{\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st}[j]}}$
	such that $\forall s\in Q, s.nextC(\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st}[j]})= \cvec{\pr}{\st}[j+1]$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	This lemma follows directly from the algorithm. Notice that whenever a process assigns a value to 
	an element of its local configuration (Lines  A\ref{algo:parser}:\ref{line:readconfig:assign} and 
	A\ref{algo:reconfigurer}:\ref{line:addconfig:assign}), it then propagates this value to a quorum of the 
	previous configuration (Lines  A\ref{algo:parser}:\ref{line:readconfig:put} and 
	A\ref{algo:reconfigurer}:\ref{line:addconfig:put}). So if a process $\pr$ assigned $c_j$ to an 
	element $\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j]$ in some state $\st'$ in $\EX$, then $\pr$ may assign a value 
	to the $j+1$ element of $\cvec{\pr}{\st''}[j+1]$ only after $\act{put-config}(\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j-1]},\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j])$
	occurs. During $\act{put-config}$ action, $\pr$ propagates $\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j]$ in a quorum 
	$Q\in\quorums{\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j-1]}}$. Hence, if $\cvec{\pr}{\st}[k]\neq\bot$, then $\pr$ 
	propagated each $\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j]$, for $0<j\leq k$ to a quorum of servers $Q\in\quorums{\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j-1]}}$.
	And this completes the proof. 
%	
%	Let examine a single element $\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j]$ that is added in the configuration vector at some state $\st'$ 
%	that appears before $\st$ in $\EX$. Whenever a configuration is assigned a process $\pr$ invokes $\act{put-config}$
%	action before adding the next configuration. According to this action, the process sends the discovered configuration
%	and sends it to a quorum of servers. As this process is repeated for every element inserted then the lemma follows. 
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Configuration Prefix]
	\label{lem:prefix}
Let $\op_1$ and $\op_2$ two 
%read/write/install operations 
completed \act{read-config} actions invoked by processes $\pr_1, \pr_2\in\idSet$ 
respectively, such that $\op_1\bef\op_2$ in an execution $\EX$. Let $\st_1$ be the state after the response 
step of $\op_1$ and $\st_2$ the state after the response step 
%termination of the first $\act{read-config}$ 
of $\op_2$. Then 
$\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}\preceq_p\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\nu_1 = \nu(\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1})$ and $\nu_2 = \nu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})$.
	By Lemma \ref{lem:unique} for any $i$ such that $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[i]\neq\bot$ and 
	$\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[i]\neq\bot$, then $\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[i]}=\config{\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[i]}$.
	Also from Lemma \ref{lem:nogaps} we know that for $0\leq j\leq \nu_1, \cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j] \neq \bot$, 
	and $0\leq j\leq \nu_2, \cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[j] \neq \bot$. So if we can show that $\nu_1\leq \nu_2$ then the lemma follows. 
	
	Let $\mu = \mu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st'})$ %, or simply $\mu$, 
	be the last finalized element which $\pr_2$ established in the beginning of 
	the $\act{read-config}$ action $\op_2$ (Line A\ref{algo:reconfigurer}:\ref{line:readconfig:final}) at some state $\st'$ before $\st_2$. 
	It is easy to see that $\mu\leq \nu_2$. If $\nu_1 \leq \mu$ then $\nu_1\leq \nu_2$ and 
	the lemma follows. Thus, it remains
	to examine the case where $\mu < \nu_1$. Notice that since $\op_1\bef\op_2$ then $\st_1$ appears before 
	$\st'$ in execution $\EX$. By Lemma \ref{lem:config:propagation}, we know that by $\st_1$, 
	%in all the configurations $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j]$, for $0\leq j < \nu_1$,  
	$\exists Q\in\quorums{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j]}}$, for $0\leq j < \nu_1$,   such that 
	$\forall s\in Q, s.nextC = \cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j+1]$. Since $\mu < \nu_1$, then it must be the case 
	that $\exists Q\in \quorums{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu]}}$ such that $\forall s\in Q, s.nextC = \cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu+1]$.
	But by Lemma \ref{lem:unique}, we know that $\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu]}= \config{\cvec{\pr_2}{\st'}[\mu]}$. 
	Let $Q'$ be the quorum that replies to the $\act{read-next-config}$ occurred in $\pr_2$, on configuration  $\config{\cvec{\pr_2}{\st'}[\mu]}$.
	By definition $Q\cap Q'\neq \emptyset$, thus there is a server $s\in Q\cap Q'$ that sends $s.nextC = \cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu+1]$
	to $\pr_2$ during $\op_2$. Since $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu+1]\neq\bot$ then $\pr_2$ assigns $\cvec{\pr_2}{*}[\mu+1]=\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu+1]$, and 
	repeats the process in the configuration $\config{\cvec{\pr_2}{*}[\mu+1]}$. Since every configuration $\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j]}$, 
		for $\mu\leq j<\nu_1$, has a quorum of servers with $s.nextC$, then by a simple induction it can be shown that the process will 
		be repeated for at least $\nu_1-\mu$ iterations, and  every configuration
		$\cvec{\pr_2}{\st''}[j]=\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j]$, at some state $\st''$ before $\st_2$. 
		Thus, $\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[j]=\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[j]$, for $0\leq j\leq \nu_1$. Hence $\nu_1\leq\nu_2$ and the lemma follows in this case as well. 
\end{proof}

Thus far we focused on the configuration member of each element in $cseq$. As operations do get in account
the \emph{status} of a configuration, i.e. $P$ or $F$, in the next lemma we will examine the relationship of 
the last finalized configuration as detected by two operations. First we present a lemma that shows the 
monotonicity of the finalized configurations.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:final:monotonic}
	Let $\st$ and $\st'$ two states in an execution $\EX$ such that $\st$ appears before $\st'$ in $\EX$.
 	Then for any process $\pr$ must hold that $\mu(\cvec{\pr}{\st})\leq \mu(\cvec{\pr}{\st'})$.  %\red{must refer to a read-config}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	This lemma follows from the fact that if a configuration $k$ is such that 
	$\status{\cvec{\pr}{\st}[k]}=F$ at a state $\st$, then $\pr$ will start any 
	future $\act{read-config}$ action from a configuration $\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j]}$
	such that $j\geq k$. But $\config{\cvec{\pr}{\st'}[j]}$ is the last finalized configuration 
	at $\st'$ and hence $\mu(\cvec{\pr}{\st'})\geq \mu(\cvec{\pr}{\st})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}  [Configuration Progress]
	\label{lem:finalconf}
	Let $\op_1$ and $\op_2$ two 
	%read/write/install operations 
	completed \act{read-config} actions invoked by processes $\pr_1, \pr_2\in\idSet$ 
	respectively, such that $\op_1\bef\op_2$ in an execution $\EX$. 
	Let $\st_1$ be the state after the response 
	step of $\op_1$ and $\st_2$ the state after the response step 
	%after the completion of $\op_1$ and $\st_2$ the state after the termination of the first $\act{read-config}$ 
	of $\op_2$. Then 
	$\mu(\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1})\leq\mu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	By Lemma \ref{lem:prefix} it follows that $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}$ is a prefix of $\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}$.
	Thus, if $\nu_1 = \nu(\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1})$ and $\nu_2 = \nu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})$, $\nu_1\leq\nu_2$.
	Let $\mu_1=\mu(\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1})$, such that $\mu_1\leq\nu_1$, be the last element in $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}$,
	where $\status{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]} = F$. Let now $\mu_2=\mu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st'})$, 
	be the last element which $\pr_2$ obtained in Line A\ref{algo:parser}:\ref{line:readconfig:final} 
	during $\op_2$ 
	%of the  $\act{read-config}$ action 
	such that $\status{\cvec{\pr_2}{\st'}[\mu_2]} = F$ in some state $\st'$ before $\st_2$. 
	If $\mu_2\geq\mu_1$, and since $\st_2$ is after $\st'$, then by Lemma \ref{lem:final:monotonic} 
	$\mu_2\leq \mu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})$ and hence $\mu_1\leq \mu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})$ as well. 
	
	It remains to examine the case where $\mu_2<\mu_1$. Process  $\pr_1$ 
	sets the status of $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]$ to $F$ in two cases: (i) either when finalizing 
	a reconfiguration, or (ii) when receiving an $s.nextC = \tup{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]}, F}$ %with status $F$ 
	from some server $s$ during a $\act{read-config}$ action. In both cases $\pr_1$ propagates the 
	$\tup{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]}, F}$ to a quorum of servers in  
	$\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1-1]}$ before completing. We know by Lemma
	\ref{lem:prefix} that since $\op_1\bef\op_2$ then $\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}$ is a prefix 
	in terms of configurations of the $\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}$. So it must be the case 
	that $\mu_2 < \mu_1 \leq \nu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})$. Thus, during $\op_2$, %the $\act{read-config}$ action, 
	$\pr_2$ starts from the configuration at index $\mu_2$ and in some iteration 
	performs $\act{get-next-config}$ in configuration $\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[\mu_1-1]$. 
	According to Lemma \ref{lem:unique}, $\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1-1]} = \config{\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[\mu_1-1]}$.
	Since $\op_1$ completed before $\op_2$, then it must be the case that $\st_1$ appears before 
	$\st'$ in $\EX$. However, $\pr_2$ invokes the $\act{get-next-config}$ operation in a state $\st''$
	which is either equal to $\st'$ or appears after $\st'$ in $\EX$. Thus, $\st''$ must appear after $\st_1$ in $\EX$.
	From that it follows that when the $\act{get-next-config}$ is executed by $\pr_2$ there is already 
	a quorum of servers in $\config{\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[\mu_1-1]}$, say $Q_1$, that received 
	$\tup{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]}, F}$from $\pr_1$. 
	Since, $\pr_2$ waits from replies from a quorum of servers from the same configuration, say $Q_2$, and since the 
	$nextC$ variable at each server is monotonic (Lemma \ref{lem:server:monotonic}), then there is a server $s\in \quo{1}\cap \quo{2}$, 
	such that $s$ replies to $\pr_2$ with $s.nextC = \tup{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]}, F}$. So, 
	$\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2}[\mu_1]$ gets $\tup{\config{\cvec{\pr_1}{\st_1}[\mu_1]}, F}$, and 
	hence $\mu(\cvec{\pr_2}{\st_2})\geq \mu_1$ in this case as well. This completes our proof.
\end{proof}
