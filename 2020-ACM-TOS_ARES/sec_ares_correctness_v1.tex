In this section, we prove that \ares{} correctly implements an atomic, read/write, shared storage service. 
%We also provide an analysis of its storage and communication costs, and the latency of read and write operations. 
In particular, we show that \ares{} ensures atomicity iff the DAP implementation in each configuration $c_i$
%relies on the satisfaction of 
%hinges on 
satisfies Property~\ref{property:dap}.
The correctness of \ares{} highly depends on the way the configuration 
sequence is constructed at each client process.
We begin by showing some critical properties preserved by the reconfiguration service proposed in \ares{} in subsection \ref{sec:safety:recon}.
Given those properties and the fact that the DAP 


% of the  used in an execution of~\ares{}. 
Therefore, we start by proving, in subsection~\ref{sec:safety:daps},  that 
Property~\ref{property:dap} holds for the DAP implementation in Section~\ref{ssec:dap:impl}. 
Based on this, in subsection ~\ref{sec:safety:b}, we prove the atomicty of \ares{}. Next, in sub-section~\ref{sec:safety:c}, we derive the storage
and communication costs of read and write operations, and in sub-section ~\ref{sec:safety:d}, we derive the latency
of reads and writes in terms of the minimum and maximum delays of any point-to-point messages of the 
underlying network.
%Due to lack of space proofs are omitted and can be found in the 
%% of the following Theorem is produced in the 
%extended version of the paper~\cite{ARES:Arxiv:2018}.	

We proceed by first introducing some definitions and notation, that we will use in the proofs that follow. 
%then by presenting some properties that are satisfied 
%	by the reconfiguration service in any execution, and then we show that given these properties our algorithm satisfies 
%	the safety (atomicity) conditions. 

	\myparagraph{Notations and definitions.}
	For a server $s$, we use the notation $\atT{s.var}{\state}$ to refer to the value of the state variable $var$, in $s$, at a state $\state$ of an  execution $\EX$. 
	If server  $s$ crashes at a state $\state_f$ in an execution $\EX$ then $\atT{s.var}{\state}\triangleq\atT{s.var}{\state_f}$ for any state variable $var$ and for 
	any state $\state$ that appears after $\state_f$ in $\EX$. 
	%refers to the value of $v$ at $s$ at the state just before crashes. In other words, $\atT{s.v}{T}  \triangleq \atT{s.v}{\hat{T}}$, where $\hat{T}$ is the latest point in the execution, such that, $(a)$ $\hat{T} \leq T$ and $(b)$ $s$ is non-faulty.


	\begin{definition}[Tag of a configuration]  Let  $c \in \mathcal{C}$ be a configuration, $\state$ be a state in some execution $\EX$ then 
		we define the tag of $c$ at state $\state$ as  
		$ \atT{tag(c)}{\state} \triangleq \min_{Q \in \quorums{c}} \max_{s \in Q}~\atT{(s.tag}{\state}).$
		We  drop the suffix $|_\state$, and simply denote as $tag(c)$,  when the state  is clear from the context.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{definition}
		Let $\sigma$ be any point in an execution of \ares{} and suppose we use the notation $\cvec{\pr}{\state}$ for $ \atT{\pr.cseq}{\state}$,  i.e., the $cseq$ variable at process $p$ at the state $\state$. %be the value of a configuration sequence vector at a process $\pr$ at some state  $\st$ in an execution $\EX$. 
		Then we define as $ \mu(\cvec{\pr}{\state})  \triangleq  \max\{ i : \cvec{\pr}{\state}[i].status = F\}$ 
		and $ \nu(\cvec{\pr}{\state}) \triangleq |\cvec{\pr}{\state}|$, where $|\cvec{\pr}{\state}|$ is the length of the  configuration vector 
		$\cvec{\pr}{\state}$. % that are not equal to $\bot$.  
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{definition} [Prefix order]
		Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be any two configuration sequences. We say that $\mathbf{x}$ is a prefix of $\mathbf{y}$, denoted by 
		$\mathbf{x} \preceq_p  \mathbf{y}$, if $\config{\mathbf{x}[j]}=\config{\mathbf{y}[j]}$, for all $j$ such that $\mathbf{x}[j]\neq\bot$.
